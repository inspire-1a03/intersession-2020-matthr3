Welcome to your project page for Electronics for the Rest of Us. You'll use this page to describe and showcase your work throughout the module. 
A place for each deliverable has been created below for you in this markdown document.

## Day 1: Reflection
<!--
In this section, provide a ~250 word reflection on your first day of the module, and discuss why you're interested in this module and what you hope to take away from it.

### I had a great first day in my Electronics for the Rest of Us module, in which I got to learn how to utilize basic functions Arduino and GitHub through the exercises through the YouTube videos posted on the Inspire 1A03 webpage. I was interested in this module because I have not taken an electronics or computer science type course since grade 11. Although I found these courses quite fascinating in the underlining codes and functions that were necessary to run programs and other electronics, for whatever reason I never really continued to pursue this field. Leading to a degree in Communications and Political Science, I have yet to have the opportunity to take a computer or electronics type course since grade 11. “Electronics” is a broad word that has actively become a large part of the 21st century’s society. I was unsure of what we were going to endeavour in these modules when I selected it as my first choice for week three, but thought it would be a good idea to gain some insight into what it would have to offer. There’s no better way to practice an interdisciplinary learning style in learning how to exercise the tasks demonstrated in these modules. After day 1, I am looking forward to continuing the multifaceted platform of GitHub and learning how to create circuits using the Arduino.

You're also asked to insert a photo that represents your accomplishments on your first day. 
- Take a photo of you working or one of your circuits and upload it to the /docs/images/ folder of this repository. 
- Then, insert your photo into your document by modifying the markdown example that has been inserted below.

## Day 2: Results
<!--
Upload your fully-commented Arduino sketch from your final Day 2 build task--a thermometer connected to an RDB LED--into your GitHub repository.
Provide a short (~150 words) summary of your work on this circuit:
- How does your device work?
- What was challenging? 
- What worked? What didn't? 
- Be sure to link to your code (in your GitHub repository) in the text of your response.
-->

## Arduino build-off results
<!--
Upload your fully-commented Arduino sketch from the final product of your Arduino build-off into the top-level of your module GitHub repository.
In ~300 words, provide a final device description and product pitch: 
- What does it do? Use a table (created in markdown) to list and describe the features. You can use the template provided below. 
- Describe briefly how it works.
- How could it be used in everyday life (or maybe just in rare cases)? 
- Be sure to link to your code (in your GitHub repository) in the text of your response.
- Include a snippet of code using the ``` ``` characters to display the code properly. 
Finally, record a short (30 second) video of a 'product pitch' for your device. 
- Upload the video to Youtube, and use the sample code below to embed your video.

Below is an example of embedding a YouTube video in a markdown document for use in GitHub pages. 
Note that this video won't show when previewing the document in GitHub--it only works on the GitHub pages webpage. 
- Once your YouTube video is uploaded, right click and select ```<> Copy embed code```. 
- You can paste this code directly into your markdown document. 
- Note that you may want to adjust the width and height parameters to make it fit well in your webpage
